Thread is the smallest unit that can be scheduled in an OS.

Threads are created using fork.

Threads are contained in processes. There can be many threads in a process. Every process contains atleast one thread (the process itself). They share memory and state of process. OS executes these threads like "parallel" processes using thread scheduling.

Types of threads:
- User level:
	not implemented in kernel
	similar to function or procedure call
- Kernel level:
 	part of OS

Advantages of threading:
- can run faster on computer systems with multiple CPU because these threads can be executed truly concurrent.
- program can remain responsive to input (on both single and multiple CPU)
- threads of same process can share the memory of global variables
- handling of threads is simpler than handling of processes for an OS. thats why they are sometimes called Light weight processes (LWP)

Modules to use in Python3:
- threading
