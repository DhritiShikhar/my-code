To change the output behaviour of interactive python shell

sys.displayhook is a built in function which is used to change the way interpreter prints interactively entered expressions. To do this bind sys.displayhook to a callable object.


>>> x = 50
>>> x
50
>>> import sys
>>> def display(x):
...   print ("The value of x: "),
...   print (x)
... 
>>> sys.displayhook = display
>>> x
The value of x: 
50
>>> print (x)
50
The value of x: 
None
